## S3 Use cases

- Backup and storage
- Disaster Recovery
- Archive
- Hybrid Cloud storage
- Application hosting
- Media hosting
- Data lakes & big data analytics
- Software delivery
- Static website

## Amazon S3 Overview - Buckets
- Amazon S3 allows people to store objects (files) in “buckets” (directories)
- Buckets must have a globally unique name (across all regions all accounts)
- Buckets are defined at the region level
- S3 looks like a global service but buckets are created in a region
- Naming convention
  - No uppercase
  - No underscore
  - 3-63 characters long
  - Not an IP
  - Must start with lowercase letter or number
  
## S3 Security

- **User based**
  - IAM policies - which API calls should be allowed for a specific user from IAM console
- **Resource Based**
  - Bucket Policies - bucket wide rules from the S3 console - allows cross account
  - Object Access Control List (ACL) – finer grain
  - Bucket Access Control List (ACL) – less common
- **Note:** an IAM principal can access an S3 object if
  - the user IAM permissions allow it OR the resource policy ALLOWS it
  - AND there’s no explicit DENY
- **Encryption:** encrypt objects in Amazon S3 using encryption keys

## S3 Bucket Policies

- JSON based policies
  - Resources: buckets and objects
  - Actions: Set of API to Allow or Deny
  - Effect: Allow / Deny
   Principal: The account or user to apply the policy to
- Use S3 bucket for policy to:
  - Grant public access to the bucket
  - Force objects to be encrypted at upload
  - Grant access to another account (Cross Account)

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "sid": "PublicRead",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3::examplebucket/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Bucket settings for Block Public Access

- Block all public access: On
  - Block public access to buckets and objects granted through new access control lists (ACLS): On
  - Block public access to buckets and objects granted through any access control lists (ACLS): On
  - Block public access to buckets and objects granted through new public bucket or access point policies: On
  - Block public and cross-account access to buckets and objects through any public bucket or access point policies: On

- These settings were created to prevent company data leaks
- If you know your bucket should never be public, leave these on
- Can be set at the account level

## S3 Websites

- S3 can host static websites and have them accessible on the www
- The website URL will be:
- bucket-name.s3-website-AWS-region.amazonaws.com
  OR
- bucket-name.s3-website.AWS-region.amazonaws.com
- **If you get a 403 (Forbidden) error, make sure the bucket policy allows public reads!**

## S3 - Versioning

- You can version your files in Amazon S3
- It is enabled at the bucket level
- Same key overwrite will increment the “version”: 1, 2, 3….
- It is best practice to version your buckets
  - Protect against unintended deletes (ability to restore a version)
  - Easy roll back to previous version
- Notes:
  - Any file that is not versioned prior to enabling versioning will have version “null”
  - Suspending versioning does not delete the previous versions
  
## S3 Access Logs

- For audit purpose, you may want to log all access to S3 buckets
- Any request made to S3, from any account, authorized or denied, will be logged into another S3 bucket
- That data can be analyzed using data analysis tools…
- Very helpful to come down to the root cause of an issue, or audit usage, view suspicious patterns, etc…  

## S3 Replication (CRR & SRR)

- Must enable versioning in source and destination
- Cross Region Replication (CRR)
- Same Region Replication (SRR)
- Buckets can be in different accounts
- Copying is asynchronous
- Must give proper IAM permissions to S3
- CRR - Use cases: compliance, lower latency access, replication across accounts
- SRR – Use cases: log aggregation, live replication between production and test accounts

### S3 Durability and Availability

- Durability:
  - High durability (99.999999999%, 11 9’s) of objects across multiple AZ
  - If you store 10,000,000 objects with Amazon S3, you can on average expect to incur a loss of a single object once every 10,000 years
  - Same for all storage classes
- Availability:
  - Measures how readily available a service is
  - Varies depending on storage class
  - Example: S3 standard has 99.99% availability = not available 53 minutes a year
  
### S3 Standard General Purpose

- 99.99% Availability
- Used for frequently accessed data
- Low latency and high throughput
- Sustain 2 concurrent facility failures
- Use Cases: Big data analystics, mobiles & gaming applications, content distribution...

### S3 Storage Classes - Infrequent Access

- For data that is less frequently accessed, but requires rapid access when needed
- Lower cost than S3 Standard

#### S3 Standard Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)

- 99.9% Availability
- Use cases: Disaster Recovery, backups

#### S3 One Zone Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA)

- High durability (99.999999999%) in a single AZ; data lost when AZ is destroyed
- 99.5% Availability
- Use Cases: Storing secondary backup copies of on-premise data, or data you can recreate

## Amazon S3 Glacier Storage Classes

- Moves objects automatically between Access Tiers based on usage
- There are no retrieval charges in S3 Intelligent-Tiering
- Frequent Access tier (automatic): default tier
- Infrequent Access tier (automatic): objects not accessed for 30 days
- Archive Instant Access tier (automatic): objects not accessed for 90 days
- Archive Access tier (optional): configurable from 90 days to 700+ days
- Deep Archive Access tier (optional): config. from 180 days to 700+ days

## S3 Object Lock & Glacier Vault Lock

- S3 Object Lock
  - Adopt a WORM (Write Once Read Many) model
  - Block an object version deletion for a specified amount of time
- Glacier Vault Lock
  - Adopt a WORM (Write Once Read Many) model
  - Lock the policy for future edits (can no longer be changed)
  - Helpful for compliance and data retention
